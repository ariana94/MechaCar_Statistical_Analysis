# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Using our RScript, we gather the following information:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle_length and ground_clearance, as well as Intercept (marked with ***)

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - No, because our Pvalues do not equal 0
 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - According to our Multiple R-squared outcome of 0.7149, our model predicts 71% accuracy
